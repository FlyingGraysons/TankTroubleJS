# TankTroubleJS
Tank Trouble in JavaScript with Socket.io

Uses JavaScript Canvas, Socket.io, and node.js.

### Running
Use `npm install` to install the dependancies.  
Then, run `node .` to actually run it.  
This will serve the website to port 3000.  
The port can also be set using an environment variable. (`export PORT=8080` for example)
